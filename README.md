# Eco Aware Load Balancing in Green Cloud Datacenters using Modified Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFOA) Algorithm

* This project is based on top of [Cloudsim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim), an open source framework for simulating Cloud infrastructure services.
* The aim is to perform load balancing optimally based on the renewable energy levels in the datacenter.
* The tradeoff between the use of renewable energy and brown energy is achieved using the ecoFactor metric.
* BFOA algorithm is used in placed of Lyapunov optimization algorithm to achieve optimality under sub-optimal conditions.
